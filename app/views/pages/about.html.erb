    <p>
      With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I
      realized that the typical product creation process between clients and
      developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to
      clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product
      that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development
      pattern that focuses on highly focused communication and transparent
      design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft
      the application according to the client's specifications, I give daily
      updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly with the client's
      goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.
